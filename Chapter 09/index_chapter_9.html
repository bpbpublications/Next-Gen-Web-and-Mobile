            <h2>Understanding Web Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Web accessibility is all about making the internet a place where everyone can join in, no matter their abilities or challenges. It is like building a playground where every child, regardless of how they move or communicate, can play and have fun. Whether someone finds it hard to hear, see, think, move, or speak, web accessibility means creating websites and online tools that they can use comfortably.</p>
